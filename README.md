# Arqueológico - Web Information System

Project for the course of Web Information Systems Development at Universidad de Granada, where we had to create a 
web-based information system for a fictional museum.

The project consists of five iterations (called prácticas here), each one made over the previous one, until the whole 
web system is created. It has been created by:

- David Vargas Carrillo ([@dvcarrillo](http://github.com/dvcarrillo)) / Front-end, back-end
- Arturo Cortés Sánchez ([@arturocs](http://github.com/arturocs)) / Back-end

## Specifications
The first two iterations, which are PHP-free, are available live.

- [**Práctica 1 (live version):**](https://dvcarrillo.github.io/arqueologico/Practica%201/Codigo/index.html) HTML and CSS. Design of main page, article view and print view.
- [**Práctica 2 (live version):**](https://dvcarrillo.github.io/arqueologico/Practica%202/Codigo/index.html) Javascript. Addition of comments to article view.
- **Práctica 3:** Adaptation of the page to PHP and creation of MySQL databases. Addition of photo galleries and more articles.
- **Práctica 4:** Implementation of users and permissions. Articles, comments and user permissions are modifiable depending on what type of user is logged in. Implementation of all the required pages and forms to make it possible.
- **Práctica 5:** Addition of a search bar on the front page that implements AJAX.

:warning: The usage of Bootstrap or grid layouts was not allowed. Therefore, the webpage is not responsive and may 
not look good when displayed at low resolution.
